## S.T.A.R

많은 기업에서 면접을 볼 때, STAR 방식으로 설명할 것을 강조한다. 간략하게 무엇인지 살펴보자.

### S : Situation

Describe the situation that you were in or the task that you needed to accomplish. <u>You must describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in the past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand.</u> This situation can be from a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.

> 예시)  
> Advertising revenue was falling off for my college newspaper, The Review, andlarge numbers of long-term advertisers were not renewing contracts.

### T : Task

What <u>goal</u> were you working toward?

> 예시)  
> My goal was to generate new ideas, materials and incentives that would result in at least a 15% increase in advertisers from the year before.

### A : Action 

Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU. <u>What specific steps did you take and what was your particular contribution?</u> Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a project, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions.

> 예시)  
> I designed a new promotional packet to go with the rate sheet and compared the benefits of The Review circulation with other ad media in the area. I also set-up a special training session for the account executives with a School of Business Administration professor who discussed competitive selling strategies.

### R : Result

Describe the <u>outcome of your actions</u> and don’t be shy about taking credit for your behavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you learn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.

> 예시)  
> We signed contracts with 15 former advertisers for daily ads and five for special supplements. We increased our new advertisers by 20 percent over the same period last year.

## 주의할점

Make sure that you follow all parts of the STAR method. <u>Be as specific as possible at all times</u>, <u>without rambling or including too much information</u>. Oftentimes students have to be prompted to include their results, so try to include that without being asked. Also, <u>eliminate any examples that do not paint you in a positive light</u>. However, keep in mind that some examples that have a negative result (such as “lost the game”) can highlight your strengths in the face of adversity.

- 항상 구체적으로 설명해야 한다.
- 횡설수설하거나 너무 많은 정보를 포함하려고 욕심 부리지 말아야 한다.
- 긍정적으로 나를 드러내지 못하는 요소들은 모두 제거하자.

## 준비하는 방법

- <u>Recall recent situations that show favorable behaviors or actions</u>, especially involving course work, work experience, leadership, teamwork, initiative, planning, and customer service.
- <u>Prepare short descriptions of each situation</u>; be ready to give details if asked.
- Be sure <u>each story has a beginning, middle, and an end</u>, i.e., be ready to describe the situation, including the task at hand, your action, and the outcome or result.
- Be sure the <u>outcome or result reflects positively on you</u> (even if the result itself was not favorable).
- <u>Be honest.</u> Don't embellish or omit any part of the story. The interviewer will find out if your story is built on a weak foundation.
- <u>Be specific.</u> Don't generalize about several events; give a detailed accounting of one event.
- <u>Vary your examples</u>; don’t take them all from just one area of your life.

## 나의 샘플 답변

- S : In 2016 Before I graduated from master degree, I was introduced to small company like start-up and I went to the States with them. I made a program inside the small security device named Ghost Waltzer. 
- T : Before I went to the States, I didn't know how many works I have to do. However I realized that there were so many demonstrations with other companies and also I had to make additional programs. 
Above all, early security device used static secret key to encrypt data. It was so dangerous and I needed to make a program generating secret key randomly per session. Then I started to develop a key exchange program to make a randomly generated secret key per session.
- A : Even though I didn't know about security and cryptographics, I decided to face it. Because unfortunately, I am the only one developer who can make a program. I analyzed all the source codes of device and figured out what should be developed.
First, I developed method generating key using DH algorithm by myself. And I had to choice whice AES bits is enough to make data encrypted inside the device. 256 bits is more complicated, however, I thought 128 is also enough to use to encrpyt data because security device consisted of very old hardware. 
I mailed to professor of my university and got an advice to make decision then I decided to adjust 128 bits of AES to encrypt data.
- R : After a month, I finally developed a key exchange program. We could show a demonstrations in front of many other companies and impressed them. My boss wanted to make a patent of key exchange program, So I wrote all the contents and applied for a patent.
And also there was a master degree gradutaion left in my life, I wrote my master degree thesis about key exchange program and finally got a diploma. I could get a confidence and this positive power has been the driving force behind me to this day.
