## Introduction: So Many Laptops, Why MacBook?

Back in my college days, ThinkPads (a.k.a. the famous red-dotted "bbalkkong") were the go-to laptops for CS majors. Brands like Dell and HP were also quite popular. Out of patriotism (and practicality), I chose a lightweight 11-inch LG laptop.

Then came the game-changer: the 13-inch Retina MacBook in 2014. I saw that crisp screen once and was sold.

Since then, for over 10 years, my main work machine has always been a MacBook. But now that MacBooks are more popular than ever — especially among developers — it’s worth asking…

**"Do you really need a MacBook to become a developer?"**

## MacBooks Are Pretty. Period

Let’s get real. One of the strongest appeals of a MacBook is its beauty. It’s not just a laptop — it’s a fashion statement, a status symbol, and yes, a design masterpiece.

From “Why would you get that overpriced laptop?” to “You must have a MacBook to code!” — the perception of the MacBook in Korea and beyond has changed drastically.

Yes, Apple’s silicon chips are powerful. Yes, Windows laptops are getting pricier too. But ultimately…

**"You buy a MacBook first because it looks amazing."**

And honestly, that’s okay.

## Is a MacBook Necessary for Developers?

Many say that since macOS is Unix-based, it’s easier for developers — especially those working with Linux servers. That was definitely true… in the past.

But Windows has caught up. With WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you can run full Linux environments natively on Windows — no need for virtual machines or complex setups.

Plus, Apple’s shift to ARM-based chips (M1, M2, M3, etc.) created some compatibility issues with traditional x86 Linux environments. While tools like Docker help mitigate that, it’s not all smooth sailing.

**"A MacBook might not always be better — just different."**

So no, being a developer doesn’t require a MacBook. Windows with WSL is now more than capable — and in some cases, even better suited for server-side development.

## The “I’ll Use It Forever” Justification

It’s common to see questions like:

**"I’m just learning to code now… should I max out the CPU and RAM?"**

My take? No. Unless you’re editing 8K videos or training AI models, a base model MacBook Air is more than enough.

I’ve used the 2020 M1 MacBook Pro for over 4 years with zero issues — and I’m a professional developer.

**"Buy for your current needs. Upgrade later if you actually need to."**

And yes, 16-inch models look cool, but they’re heavy. If you commute on foot or public transport, go 14-inch or smaller.

## Is macOS Hard to Use?

For lifelong Windows users: yes, at first. macOS does things differently — keyboard shortcuts, window management, file system, etc.

But you’ll adapt. Humans are adaptable creatures.

If you’re used to Microsoft Office or specific Korean software, there might be hiccups — but these days, most major apps support macOS just fine.

And yes, macOS no longer struggles with Korean fonts or certificates. That ship has sailed.

## The Hidden Costs: Accessories & Compatibility

You might need to buy extra accessories.

- USB hubs, dongles, adapters — they add up.
- Cheaper accessories can cause damage. Get reputable brands.

Windows on Mac? Not easy anymore.

- Since Apple moved to their own chips, BootCamp is gone.
- You’ll need virtualization software (like Parallels), and even that costs money -  plus a Windows license.

## But What About Apple Ecosystem & Aesthetics?

Some say:

**"If you have an iPhone, iPad, AirPods — you should definitely get a MacBook too."**

Not necessarily.

Sure, continuity features like AirDrop or shared clipboard are nice. But you won’t lose much by not having them either.

You don’t need to complete the Apple Infinity Gauntlet.

Also: yes, it looks amazing at Starbucks. My wife uses a Galaxy Book, I still take my MacBook.

## Can You Game on a Mac?

Short answer: You can. Long answer: It’s not ideal, but it’s getting better.

Cloud gaming, browser-based games, and new compatibility layers (like Wine, Crossover, etc.) help. But if you’re a serious gamer? Stick with Windows.

**"But hey, long gaming sessions aren’t healthy anyway."**

## Final Thoughts

I’ve used MacBooks for over 10 years — and never regretted it. But that doesn’t mean it’s the right choice for everyone.

Here’s what I’ll say:

Get a MacBook if:

- You love the design
- You want a reliable, well-optimized device
- You value battery life and quiet operation
- You’re okay adapting to macOS

Don't get one if:

- You’re on a tight budget
- You need specific Windows-only software
- You game a lot

Buy what fits your budget and purpose. Don’t overthink it. And remember — MacBooks are not mandatory for developers.

Hope this post helps you make a better decision!
