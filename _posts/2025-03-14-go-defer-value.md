## The Problem

Consider the following Go function:

```go
func f() error {
    var status string  // Initialized as an empty string
    defer notify(status)

    if err := foo(); err != nil {
        status = "error"  // Status changes here, but defer does not reflect this change
        return err
    }

    status = "success"
    return nil
}
```

We might expect notify(status) to reflect the latest value of status.
However, in reality, it always receives an empty string (`""`), regardless of how status is updated later.

## The Reason why status is not updated

```go
var status string // ""
```

- `status` is initialized as an empty string
- `defer` evaluates its arguments immediately when declared.
  - When `defer notify(status)` is called, `status` is still an empty string.
  - Thus, `defer` captures the empty string(`""`) at this moment and never updates, even if `status` changes later.
- Even though `status` is modified in the function, the deferred function call was already bound to the original value of `status` (empty string).
- In Go, when a function is deferred, its arguments are evaluated and stored immediately—not when the function actually executes.

## How to Fix It?

To ensure that notify(status) receives the latest value of status, we can use two different approaches.

### 1. Using a Closure (Anonymous Function)

```go
defer func() { notify(status) }()
```

- Instead of immediately passing `status` to `notify`, we defer an anonymous function.
- This function captures `status` at the moment `defer` executes, ensuring it reflects the latest value.
- When `notify(status)` is finally called, it uses the updated value of `status`.

### 2. Passing a Pointer

```go
defer notify(&status)
```

- Instead of passing the value of `status`, we pass its memory address (`&status`).
- Since `defer` captures the pointer, any changes to `status` are reflected at execution time.
- However, this requires modifying `notify` to accept a pointer parameter.

```go
// If using a pointer, notify must be updated:
// Dereference the pointer to get the latest value
func notify(status *string) {
    fmt.Println(*status) 
}
```

### 3. Comparison of Solutions

| Approach | How it Works | Requires Function Signature Change? | Best Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Closure (Anonymous Function) | Captures `status` at execution time | No | Works for most cases |
| Pointer Passing (&status) | Passes a pointer, reflects latest value | Yes | When working with functions that support pointers |

## Conclusion

- Deferred functions capture arguments immediately, not when they actually run.
- If the deferred function needs the latest value, use:
  - Closures (Anonymous Functions): Recommended, as they don’t require modifying function signatures.
  - Pointers (&status): Useful when modifying function behavior explicitly.
